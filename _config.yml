# Frequently asked questions.
faq:
  - question: "What is a hackathon?"
    answer: >
      A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
      software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's [very beginner friendly]
      (https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl).
      CuseHacks is not your typical hackathon. We encourage students with any level of experience to sign up.
